This PlayBook is not to give a full course on R, but it will help with the most common actions to perform, while doing a (Data Science) analysis of a dataset."

To indicate that it is a vector of length _k_ , we will use $a \\in \\Re_{k}$ (or $a \\in \\Re_{n}$ if it is of length _n_ ). We will indicate that an object is a r x s matrix using $A \\in \\Re^{r x s}$ .  In some rare instances it is important to understand the concept of multiplying two matrices. Suppose that <font color='red'>$A \\in \\Re^{rxd}$</font> and $B \\in \\Re^{dxs}$ . Then the product of A and B is denoted AB. The ( _i_ , _j_ )th element of AB is computed by ultiplying each element of the _i_ th row of A by the corresponding element of the _j_ th column of B. That is <font color='red'>(AB)$_{ij}$ =  $\\sum_{k=1}^{d} a_{ik}b_{kj}$</font> ."
